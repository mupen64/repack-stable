---@class Sheet Describes the data required to manage, store and edit the ordered sections of a sheet.
---@field public version string The file version of this sheet. See Version.lua for more information.
---@field public preview_input SelectionInput The input to which to proceed when re-running the game after a change.
---@field public active_input SelectionInput The input whose controls to display in the "Inputs" page.
---@field public sections Section[] The sections to execute in order.
---@field public name string A name for the sheet for convenience.
---@field public busy boolean Whether the sheet is waiting for the game to run until its preview input.
---@field public measured_section_lengths { [Section]: integer } The last measured length in frames for each section that has run at least once.
---@field private _section_index integer The nth section that is currently being played.
---@field private _input_index integer The nth SectionInputs of the current section being played
---@field private _frame_counter integer The nth frame of the current input that is currently being played.
---@field private _section_frame_counter integer The counter used to determine measured_section_lengths.
---@field private _base_sheet Sheet | nil The sheet that should be run before this sheet, if defined. Otherwise, [_savestate](lua://cls_sheet._savestate) must be defined.
---@field private _savestate ByteBuffer | nil The savestate this sheet runs from, if defined. Otherwise [_base_sheet](lua://cls_sheet._base_sheet) must be defined.
---@field private _on_preview_input_reached function | nil A one-time callback to invoke when this sheet has run to its preview frame. Used to chain sheets that are based on top of one another.
---@field private _invalidated boolean Whether the sheet has changed since the last time [run_to_preview](lua://cls_sheet.run_to_preview) has been called.
local cls_sheet = {}

---Constructs a new sheet with the given name and a single section.
---
---If `createSavestate` is set, the sheet will be "based" on the game's current state.
---Otherwise, a savestate MUST be supplied either
---via [load](lua://cls_sheet.load), [rebase](lua://cls_sheet.rebase) or [set_base_sheet](lua://cls_sheet:set_base_sheet)
---before calling [run_to_preview](lua://cls_sheet.run_to_preview).
---@param name string The name of the sheet.
---@param create_savestate boolean Whether to create a savestate.
---@return Sheet sheet The new sheet.
function cls_sheet.new(name, create_savestate) end

---Retrieves the inputs for the next frame and advances this sheet's internal counters
---such that sequential invocations will yield the appropriate frames to advance the game with.
---@return SectionInputs inputs The inputs to advance the game's next frame with.
function cls_sheet:evaluate_frame() end

---Runs the game until the end of the preview input of this sheet.
---@param from_base boolean | nil Whether to run the sheet from its defined base, which may be either a savestate or another sheet. Defaults to true.
function cls_sheet:run_to_preview(from_base) end

---Saves this sheet's data and associated savestate into `file` and `file`.savestate (if applicable) respectively.
---@param file string The file path to save to (absolute or relative).
function cls_sheet:save(file) end

---Loads this sheet's data and associated savestate from `file` and `file`.savestate (if applicable) respectively.
---@param file string The file path to load from (absolute or relative).
---@param load_state boolean Whether the sheet has an associated savestate to load.
function cls_sheet:load(file, load_state) end

---Sets the savestate this sheet runs from with the game's current state. Calling this function will disassociate this sheet from its base sheet if defined.
function cls_sheet:rebase() end

---Sets the sheet after whose preview input to run this sheet from.
---@param base_sheet Sheet The sheet after whose preview input to start this sheet. Calling this function will disassociate this sheet from its savestate if defined.
function cls_sheet:set_base_sheet(base_sheet) end

---Retrieves whether this sheet or any of its ancestors have changes that may change the outcome of [run_to_preview](lua://cls_sheet.run_to_preview).
